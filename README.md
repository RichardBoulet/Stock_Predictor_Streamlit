Testing deployment of simple stock price predictor for next 7 days (model and code built on from https://testdriven.io/blog/fastapi-machine-learning/ ) to explore Streamlit app. 

Future additions planned:
1- Build upon iris deployment to FastAPI after errors in original material with this streamlit app, which may look to Dash for this as well. 
2- Look at using Flask in conjunction with Streamlit and Dash and ease of use.
